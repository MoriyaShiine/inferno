  <h3>Makes several changes to how fire works in order to create a more dynamic experience, as well as adding some shiny new content to reward you for aiding in environmental restoration.</h3>

### Smoke
- The more fire is nearby, the more intense smoke will be.

### Remains
- When logs burn, they have a chance to turn into Charred Logs - these will drop 1-4 Charcoal when broken, or if broken with Silk Touch, can be used to smelt 40 items.
- Grass Blocks are now flammable and turn into Scorched Earth, which can be fertilized with Bone Meal to grow a host of new plants. Scorched Earth will also heal naturally in the rain.

### Plants
- When fertilized, Scorched Earth will grow into a variety of new plants. As long as 5 or more Scorched Earth are fertilized, 2 plants will always grow from the remains.
  - Beargrass, Goldenrod, Golden Poppy, Fireweed, and Prairie Fire are shown below.

 ### Shining Oak
 - Scorched Earth also has a rare chance to spawn a Shining Oak Sapling, which will grow into a beautiful new fireproof tree, with its own dedicated wood set.
   - The leaves will be either iron or golden, and are randomly chosen when the sapling grows into a tree.
   - Placing Iron or Gold blocks (ore, raw block, or block) beneath the ground the sapling grows on will guarantee the type of tree you want!

### On Soul Fire
- Entities caught on fire from Soul Fire will be set on soul fire, taking double damage.

### Copper Fire
- Blocks made out of Copper will burn with a green fire. Also adds Copper Campfires!

### Lower Hud Fire
- Fire is lowered in the game HUD automatically, and works with resource packs that change the fire texture.

### Entity Fire Spread
- Entities will spread fire while ignited. Projectiles have a significantly lower chance to do this, and entities that were set on fire from the sun will not spread fire at all.

### Torch Ignition
- Attacking an entity with a Torch or Soul Torch will destroy the torch and ignite them appropriately.
